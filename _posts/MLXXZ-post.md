In this work, we applied Machine Learning techniques to classify the quantum phases of the XXZ model ground state based on entanglement and entanglement spectrum. Utilizing the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm, we determined the ground state of the XXZ model with 160 sites. The ground state was partitioned into an 80-site bipartition, allowing us to measure quantum correlations between the partitions by computing the entanglement entropy and entanglement energies. Our analysis involved training a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) learning algorithm to identify the correspondence between quantum information resources and quantum matter phases. The results demonstrated high accuracy, with the MLP achieving approximately 0.93 and the $k$-NN achieving approximately 0.98.
