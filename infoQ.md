## Notes on Quantum Information

üìö *These notes are currently in Portuguese and still under development.*

These are my personal teaching notes on Quantum Information, written with a focus on geometrical and foundational aspects of the theory. The content explores quantum operations, open quantum systems, information theory, and quantum geometry, including the use of K√§hler manifolds, Fubini-Study metric, and the Bloch sphere.

üß† Topics include:
- Classical and quantum noise
- Entropic measures and communication theory
- Complex projective space and its role in quantum state geometry
- Quantum phase space and coherent states
- Positive and completely positive maps
- Geometric aspects of quantum measurements and transformations

### üìñ Suggested Reference (in English)

If you‚Äôre looking for a reference in English, I recommend the excellent book:

> **"Geometry of Quantum States: An Introduction to Quantum Entanglement"**  
> Ingemar Bengtsson and Karol ≈ªyczkowski  
> Cambridge University Press, 2017

It provides a comprehensive and mathematically grounded introduction to the geometry of quantum theory, from pure and mixed states to entanglement and majorization.
