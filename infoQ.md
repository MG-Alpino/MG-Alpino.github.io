On this page, you will find my lecture notes on Quantum Information Theory Mechanics. This version of the notes is tailored for graduate students in physics (or related fields) who have a solid understanding of linear algebra and probability theory. Within these notes, you will find examples and exercises (some of which are solved), along with proposals for computational implementations. My computational material can be accessed in the "codes" section of my website.
