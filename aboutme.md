Welcome to my academic portfolio. My name is Marcos Gabriel Alpino, a master's student at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), specializing in Quantum Information. My research interests lie particularly in the application of quantum information theory to strongly correlated systems.

On this site, you will find my lecture notes, coding projects, and a collection of my scientific interests. I aim to contribute to the field by exploring and developing new insights into the quantum realm, particularly focusing on the complex interactions within strongly correlated systems.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the resources here both informative and inspiring.

### NOTE
- I rock a great mustache;
- I'm extremely loyal to my family;
- Check my Counts =)
