Welcome to my academic portfolio. I'm Marcos Gabriel Alpino, a master's student at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), where I specialize in Quantum Information. My primary focus is on applying quantum information theory to explore the intricate behavior of many-body systems.

Here, you'll find a curated selection of my lecture notes, coding projects, and scientific pursuits. Through this space, I aim to share insights and contribute to the advancement of our understanding of quantum phenomena.

Thank you for stopping by — I hope the materials here prove both informative and inspiring.
