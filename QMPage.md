Welcome to my notes on Quantum Mechanics. This page is under construction, but you can already access the PDF version of the material:

ðŸ“„ [Download the notes (PDF)]([/assets/pdf/Notes_QM.pdf](https://mg-alpino.github.io/assets/pdf/Notes_QM.pdf))

These notes aim to be a concise and mathematically rigorous reference on the formal aspects of quantum theory. Although still being developed, they cover foundational topics such as vector spaces, operators, quantum states, and symmetry transformations.

Feel free to get in touch with comments or suggestions!
